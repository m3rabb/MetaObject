- using proxies for meta-programming. the challenges of using proxies for privacy and also enabling shared (inherited) properties.
- challenges of enabling proxies for properties vs just methods.

- how Chrome determines the class type of an obj, and how unfortunately it doesnt handle proxies :-(

- testing (I hate tests, I love tests)
- immutability

// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze

// To be a constant object, the entire reference graph
// (direct and indirect references to other objects)
// must reference only immutable frozen objects.
// The object being frozen is said to be immutable because the
// entire object state (values and references to other objects)
// within the whole object is fixed.  Note that strings, numbers,
// and booleans are always immutable and that Functions and Arrays
// are objects.
