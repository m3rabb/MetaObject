But first, a little history...

I've been programming in JavaScript for 10 years.  After being a Smalltalk programmer for more that 10 years before, it was obvious that I could no longer count on finding Smalltalk work, and needed to embrace a new primary language.  Preferring dynamic languages, I decided to look into Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. Knowing that the design of Ruby was influenced by Smalltalk, I was hopeful, but ultimately disappointed in it. Ruby was a pale (and ugly) shadow of Smalltalk, but most importantly had terrible debugging support.  One for the joys of Smalltalk programming was its live debugger.  Debugging and writing code become one activity versus two disconnect ones. I moved onto JavaScript, quickly feel in love with its excellent in browser debugging, deep dynamism, and prototypal type mechanism.  After a quick check, discovering that Python's debugging support was a weak as Ruby's, JavaScript was it for me.

For years before, I'd ignored (and maligned) JavaScript. I had a well deserved reputation for being full of bizarre and nasty peculiarities (WAT).  Fortunately, just as I'd decided to get serious about the JavaScript, Crockford had released JavaScript: The Good Parts (TGP).  It demonstrated that the language could be improved by simply being disciplined and avoiding many of it features. At its core JavaScript is wonderful (reasonably) consistent expressive little language.  His book was a roadmap for staying out of the notorious JavaScript weeds, and a beginning for me in writing beautiful JavaScript. Not long after, JavaScript ES5 was released. ES5 was a radical update for a programming language.  Over time, as languages evolve they tend to add features.  ES5's "strict mode" was a way for it to do the opposite, and actually eliminate a number JavaScript's most dangerous and/or semantically inconsistent features.  This was particularly challenging as the internet was depended upon vast amounts of code depended on features that they no (rightly) wanted to deprecate.  One of ECMAScript committee's mantras was, "Don't break the web!"

At the time, I was a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and made a serious effort at studying the semantic of the JavaScript language.  I was interested in how the changes to the language would impact its reliablity and mantainability. While it took many years for ES5 and strict mode to be fully supported and embraced, it did help.  In the following years, JavaScript has had quite a renaisannce, had an explosion of packages, libraries and frameworks, becoming a rich ecosystem. There have been several more official updates to the language. The landscape has become fragmented, and nowadays most JavaScript programmers have a hard time keeping up, and deciding which way to go.


While it's a great time to be a JavaScript programming, I believe that hardcore JavaScript programmers (officionados) have Stockholm Syndrome.  Experience with other languages, shows that things could be so much better.
