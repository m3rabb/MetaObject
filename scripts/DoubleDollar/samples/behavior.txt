intercepting method declaration enables:
- dynamic immutbale copying
- privacy

setting on things is NOT allowed

getting
- when getting a property always return it as a fact

Methods must be saved as facts

when exec a method
- if mutable
-- send to inner
-- return self or a fact
- if immutable
-- inner copy wrapper to capture sets
-- send to copy wrapper
-- return a fact or copy from wrapper



As Fact
- primitives
- [IS_FACT]
- "object" --> make deeply immutable copy and mark as a fact
- "function" --> wrap in function to ensure
-- censors arguments ( because interior of func could assign )
-- make sure return value is a fact


function method(x, y) {

  return function (g) {
    g.abc = this
  }
}
