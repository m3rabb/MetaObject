Perhaps name classes with $, such as $Method to signify them as immutable instances


Type.new("", [Plastic, Robotic, Flying, Mammal], function (ToyBat) {})

Type.new(function (ToyBat, Plastic, Robotic, Flying, Mammal) {

})

- private local (unsearchable/unfindable) types
- inner access to types
- locking types so they are not extensible
- decouple the Inner_root from all types, so that if a vilain makes a
new type it doesnt infect all of the other types
-- perhaps fully separate copies of the type hierachy
-- OR immutable base types hierarchy, and multiple discrete subcontexts

a type should be definable as non-extensible to prevent improper use of inherited private methods



Make outer objects write-once by default



function _super(supertype) {
  const type = this.$type
  const ancestors = _type[_$ancestor]
  ancestors.forEach(ancestor => {
    const root = ancestor._instanceRoot
    if ()
  })
}

this._super.bark()
this._as(Dog).bark()

this._asExec(Dog, "bark", name, supertypes)

get (func, selector, outer) {
  func[_$super](selector)
}

// Top.addOMethod(function isThing(target) {
//   if (target[INTER] === SECRET) { return true }
//   const inner = InnerWeakMap.get(target)
//   return (target === inner[OUTER])
// })

Top.addOMethod(function isThing(target) {
  return target ||
    (target[INTER] === SECRET) ||
    (InnerWeakMap.get(target) !== undefined)
})





two ways:
$someProperty --> fixed property
someProperty$ --> immutable value at property


===
- When accessing Types within Contexts, consider wrapping them in a proxy, so
  that if they are attempted to be modified, a new copy instead is generated
  instead.  The krusts would now, also need to detect such wrapped objects and
  and unwrapped them and rewrap them properly.

===
About to take steps to remove the vulnerability/dependency of direct access to super type hierarchy from below.
- Within contexts, one can create and use new types. These types are inner objects.
- When a context is closed its types and properties become immutable
- Within contexts, one can access types inherited from super contexts as immutable inner objects
- Outside of a context one accesses its properties, including contained types, as outer objects, which themselves make outer objects.
