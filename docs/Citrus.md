Why citrus.  Because I'm a citrus enthusiast!

- new is a problematic operator
- JS's object model is confusing
- functions do double duty, this is inappropriate

- Consistent programmer model (the implementation model)
JS no separation of the implementation and programmer model which is fine Citrus separates them for the sake of simplifying the programmer model

- private methods
- handling of (most) unexpected message sends
- get around reserve words to have full vocabulary of naming
- formalize types/classes as 1st class objects, and their relationship with their instances to be un/less surprising compared to other OOPLs
- conventions for immutability
- conventions for optional vars

- formal handling of privacy that avoids memory explosion
- various levels of security
- consistent unordered param handling

- rich accessor creation methods

- formalization of object vs type methods
